Analysis description

Corresponding script is pfos_alt.py.

This analysis is basically evaluating models with sequences not included in model training.

Artificial sequence construct is generated by concatenating 29-AA length fragments
(Due to the value calculation methods, it does not affect other sites' prediction results)

Two constructs are generated:
- Construct generated from training set fragment (used for training models)
- Construct generated from residuals (sequences not included in training set: see folder 01)

In each constructs, 100 phosphorylation sites and 100 non-phosphorylated sequences are contained.
(this makes each constructs 29 x 2 x 100 = 5800 AA length)

After running PHOSforUS, results for known sites are collected and accuracy is calculated.

100x iteration is done, and average accuracy for each constructs are calculated.
